FTL
===

FTL is an experimental server framework heavily based on `warp`, but without the Filter system. Instead, it uses simple Rust `match` statements
for routing and simple parameters and return values for data flow. No attempt at fancy abstractions are made, and the code can be made as optimized as possible.

More details will be added later.
